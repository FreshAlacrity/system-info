# Coordinate System Rights, Commitments, and Expectations

Composed & translated by members of [Cohort 6a](https://pk.mt/g/wttutt) and [Cohort 8g](https://pk.mt/g/qaiba) with feedback + commentary from others

All rights listed have been approved by full [Consensus](consensus_process.md)


## Commitments as a Collective

* to maintain and support the active consent of everyone involved in decisions that affect them or the collective as a whole as much as we can (including offering encouragement and making accessible spaces available)
* to share resources according to the needs and requests of folks who can use them
* to uphold and support each other's responsibilities and commitments, with the knowledge that we rely on each other and others rely on us
* to nurture ourselves, our headmates, and the other people in our lives in the present and the future
* to value and promote cooperation and compassion, show gratitude, and positively reinforce behaviors that support our commitments
* to seek mutual benefit and curtail harm wherever possible, both within our system and with others
* to work on being more public about being [plural](https://morethanone.info/#terms) over time, when and where that feels safe


## General Rights & Responsibilities
*Rights and expectations we extend to all people, including all individuals within and external to our collective (or any other [system](https://morethanone.info/#terms) or collective):*

* to seek and respect consent, to withdraw that consent without needing to give a reason, and to have time made for renegotiating existing agreements
* to respect and communicate about our needs and boundaries and the needs and boundaries of others
* to give each other space to be individuals; to participate, express ourselves, and to take down time and alone time as needed
* to own our actions and feelings, both individually and as a collective, and to keep our emotions from blinding us to harm we may be causing
* to communicate in good faith; to be clear and accurate to our experiences and knowledge (including being willing to discuss how we’re feeling in the moment and about specific topics, if and when we feel able, comfortable, and safe doing so)
* to ask for help when we need it, and to accept help that we know we need
* to assess our own actions and decide if they are good or bad for ourselves
    * not try to have power or control over other people without their explicit consent, and even then to encourage and support them to be independent in negotiating and participating in Consensus
* to have our existing relationships respected and to respect the existing relationships people are in and not seek to separate them from others
    * this includes external folk respecting our internal structures, for example by understanding when we choose to forgo things out of respect for our headmates and their respective duties, values, and preferences
* to be respected and treated with consideration
    * to have our limits and values respected
    * to have and find healthy ways to express our own feelings, preferences, and ideas without being afraid of how someone else will react
    * to have friends and find our own spaces without being restricted in who we can see
    * to [front](https://morethanone.info/#terms) or not front according to our own decisions
    * to say no to requests, activities, or being touched by anyone, at any time for any reason
    * to be treated as an expert on the subject of our own experiences
* to speak freely - without interference or pressure - to people we're out to
    * to have the best possible translation assistance
    * to speak up when we think someone else's actions or language are unfair or hurtful (with the exception of when the system has unanimously agreed to block or have no contact with an external individual or system)
    * to not be outed as a system or as queer/trans/disabled/etc without giving prior consent
* to participate in [Consensus](#consensus_process.md) (our shared decision making process)
    * to call for an immediate Consensus vote (note that the likely outcome of a call for a Consensus vote on an issue that members do not have time to discuss or prepare for is often no consensus, since a decision is not possible yet)
    * to request information on an ongoing Consensus process, limited to what positions are being held (but not by whom) and whether or not a formal Consensus has been reached
    * to designate a mediator or advocate to speak on your behalf to the best of their ability for the purpose of Consensus (these can be designated in advance and extends to all internal and external persons and collectives; a mediator can be an external person or collective and an external person or collective can request an advocate within the system to act on their behalf internally)


## Rights for All Coordinates
*Rights of all current and future headmates within our system, regardless of past participation or ability to front or speak without assistance:*

* to refuse to [fuse](https://pluralpedia.org/w/Fusion), [merge](https://pluralpedia.org/w/Merging), or [front](https://pluralpedia.org/w/Fronting), stop fronting or un-merge, or specify that you would not like any future such invitations until further notice, at any time and without needing to state a reason
* to date and/or have intimate relationships independently and without needing to check in with the collective first (although it’s very much encouraged to make sure prospective sweeties are aware that they probably won't have a lot of privacy from the collective and to discuss what things with other members and in particular members from the same *[cohorts](#heading=h.v7xgdzs6hhn2)* could look like in advance, and required to give general information to the system about any actions taken that may affect our STI risks)
* with approval of an appropriate guild member or any member who has taken on their duties (without needing to have a full [Consensus](#heading=h.pmq4wo6r47xj)):
    * to use/access a portion of available resources (for example, a duration of front time or amount of money) without needing to say what it’s for
    * to request privacy for specific memories (this can be scheduled in advance)
        * for the purposes of accurate records, acting archivists may still access these and as such have a duty to treat what is archived with care and respect, including keeping the contents of private memories confidential
* to request anonymous information from memory archives 
    * for example, what the body was up to at a given time, what money was spent on but not who spent it, etc. but not who was fronting during a particular timespan or specific details of private memories
* to be heard on a [Consensus](consensus_process.md) issue (whether up to date with the discussion or not)
* to withdraw from any [Consensus](consensus_process.md) decision, at any time and without needing to state a reason, including decisions that were made before you could be present or that you previously agreed to
    * doing so invalidates the Consensus and starts a new [Consensus process](consensus_process.md) to determine what further action around that issue/topic will look like
* to re-negotiate duties and/or receive assistance in finding and settling into a new role or position within the system, including being assigned a [council seat](terms_used.md#council-seat) and creating a corresponding new [district](terms_used.md#district-or-guild)


## Rights of Guild Members

* to withdraw from a guild or being asked to uphold the responsibilities associated with that guild, without needing to state a reason
* to delegate or defer completion of any duties for self-care reasons (and if possible to delegate/arrange a backup in advance, to keep things running smoothly)
