# Terminology used by the Coordinate System
Composed by members of [Cohort 8g](https://pk.mt/g/qaiba) with feedback + commentary from others
## Terms
*as used by the Coordinate System; see also [MoreThanOne.info](https://morethanone.info/#terms) for an introduction to more general plural terminology and [Pluralpedia](https://pluralpedia.org/) for a much larger dictionary of plural-related terms*
### &
when appended to a pronoun, acts as a reference to that person’s entire system
ex: you& - you and your system, me&  - me and my system
### Consensus
our internal decision-making process; a combination of polling and negotiation, with the goal of reaching unanimous consent on how we want to handle a specific issue or situation (see the separate document on [how Consensus works](consensus_process.md))
a Consensus can also refer to the decided outcome of a Consensus process
#### council/councilor
the internal council refers to the members of the system who often participate in Consensus decisions regardless of whether they are personally invested in the outcome
due to [how Consensus works](consensus_process.md), councilors do not rule or govern with more inherent authority than other members, however they are more often involved and thus tend to have more influence (and as such have a greater responsibility towards the system as a whole, in addition to any members who have opted to be represented by them)
#### council seat
the default position/order in which a member is invited to speak during rounds of the *Consensus* process, represented by the first numerical digit/*[district](#district-guild)* listed in their *[callsign](#callsign)* (and from there, alphabetical order as needed)
what *[cohorts](#cohort)* and *[councilors](#council-councilor)* each seat corresponds to, the number of seats, and the order of the seats has changed over time within the system, although they do largely stay the same from year to year
any *[coordinate](#coordinate-coordinates)* can request a seat at any time, which begins a *[Consensus](#consensus)* on what seat they will be assigned to
### coordinate/coordinates
any/all system members/*[headmates](#headmate)* within the [Coordinate System](https://pk.mt/s/lhexq)
### district/guild
a location or organization within our *[headspace](#headspace-mindscape)* occupied largely by members of one or more *[cohorts](#cohort)* with shared aesthetic and/or architectural preferences, interests, and preferred occupation and/or skills
opting into a guild does not obligate a member to perform any of the *[duties](#duties-roles)* associated with that district, however any members from a district will often be called upon to perform any associated role (to “act in the capacity” of that district) if they are willing and able
likewise, opting into a guild does not obligate a member to maintain a residence in the area in our headspace occupied primarily by that guild
by convention each district is assigned a *[council seat](#council-seat)* and expected to send at least one member to participate in *[Consensus](#consensus)* decisions as a *[councilor](#council-councilor)*, but doing so is not required
ex: [District 9](https://pk.mt/g/iyusd) currently includes [Cohort 9h](https://dash.pluralkit.me/profile/g/khuwfv) and [9z](https://dash.pluralkit.me/profile/g/zeyofa) (specified using *[callsign](#callsign)* notation) and residents are informally known as 9’s or “nines” or “Witches” (as a reference to common duties performed by members District 9, including divination and generally handling anything outside the purview of the other districts)
#### home district
a members’ home district is the district in which they currently maintain a residence or can commonly be found in our volcanic island *[headspace](#headspace-mindscape)*
a home district listing may include a reference to a specific *[cohort](#cohort)* to indicate a more specific area within that district
#### concept-relationship thought
a unit of thought that can be passed between *[headmates](#headmate)* in our system quickly and efficiently; the basic element of our internal sublanguage
* these generally reference one or two abstract concepts (or a reference to one or more individuals), a specific relationship between the concepts, and an emotion, impression, or subjective internal experience related to that relationship
* [nonspeaking](https://stimpunks.org/glossary/nonspeaking/) headmates in our system can also form, share, and understand these thoughts, but more generally struggle to translate them into English and may require another headmate to act as *[translator](#translator)* or use [Signed English](https://www.signingsavvy.com/blog/45/The+difference+between+ASL+and+English+signs) or [AAC](https://stimpunks.org/glossary/alternative-and-augmentative-communication/)
* *[internal name translations](#internal-name)* are attempts to more directly convey these thought-units in English
### duties/roles
our system does not use strict [roles](https://pluralpedia.org/w/Role); instead members may take on any role they believe they are capable of performing in a way that honors the applicable *[Consensus](#consensus)* agreements at any time
members may also freely dispute any Consensus agreements that might prevent them from acting in a given capacity, which immediately nullifies the Consensus in question
each *[district](#district-guild)* has associated roles that members may be called on to perform, but can always opt out or delegate that role to another headmate
we do not use and are not comfortable with having archetype roles such as "[protector](https://pluralpedia.org/w/Protector)" or "[persecutor](https://pluralpedia.org/w/Persecutor)" applied to ourselves or our headmates
#### translator
a headmate who excels at and is willing to assist other headmates with translating *[internal speech](#concept-relationship-thought)*, usually to spoken or written English
this role within the system is not associated with a particular *[district](#district-guild)*
#### mediator
a *[Consensus](#consensus)* specific role assumed for the purpose of a specific [Consensus process](consensus_process.md)
### external
outside of the collective; all plural folks, [singlets](https://morethanone.info/#terms), etc that aren’t part of or *[internal](#internal)* to the system
#### outerworld
the external shared reality outside of the system
#### stigmergy
‘a mechanism of indirect coordination, through the environment, between agents or actions. The principle is that the trace left in the environment by an individual action stimulates the performance of a succeeding action by the same or different agent’ (Wikipedia)
this is a big part of how our collective coordinates with each other - we leave our digital, material, and external environment set up in a way that prompts the next person along to get one step further toward complete a task needs to be done (etc), instead of dictating what should get done first or who needs to do it
#### shared persona/singletsona
the combination of legal “person” and social mask a [system](https://morethanone.info/#terms) is often obliged to put on in order to navigate an external society designed around [singlets](https://morethanone.info/#terms)
#### PluralKit
a [Discord](https://discord.com/) Bot that facilitates conversations with multiple different *[headmates](#headmate)* within a system, available via [pluralkit.me](https://pluralkit.me/)
### fronting
having or sharing active control of the body; being tuned into and participating in current *[outerworld](#outerworld)* activities of the system
in our system headmates usually front in some capacity to speak to other fronters, but fronters can speak to non-fronting *[headmates](#headmate)* briefly without leaving *[the front](#the-front)* (this is by convention; it’s a bit like the driver being able to yell into the back of the bus to get someone’s help or attention, meanwhile it’s not good to distract the driver unless you can tell when they need to focus)
#### captain’s chair fronting
one fronter (the notional “captain on deck”) with authority and control over the body
the opposite of *[popcorn fronting](#popcorn-fronting)*
* other headmates can be present/fronting and lend advice, but cannot actively use the body unless the current “captain” allows it
* the “captain” must still respect the rights and obligations of other *[coordinates](#coordinate-coordinates)* as usual - it’s just a different way to manage *[the front](#the-front)*
#### copilot
a second headmate that is assisting or supporting the headmate *[taking point](#taking-point)*
#### holding down the front
staying in front so someone is there; implies that most or all other headmates are either tired or uninterested in fronting
#### popcorn fronting
multiple fronters checking in briefly to make note of something or help with a task in quick succession, often while another person is *[taking point](#taking-point)*
the opposite of *[captain’s chair fronting](#captain’s-chair-fronting)*
#### taking point
taking a primary role in fronting; the personality and presentation of the person taking point will often dominate how we appear to others during that time
* aspects of other fronters may bleed through, particularly during *[popcorn fronting](#popcorn-fronting)*
* aspects of other fronters are generally not visible during *[captain’s chair fronting](#captain’s-chair-fronting)*
* it is not necessary in our system for anyone to be taking point; we can be co-conscious without taking priority, it just helps to have a tiebreaker so we don’t get our hands tangled trying to do two things at once
### headmate
our preferred term for individual members of the [Coordinate System](#coordinate-coordinates)
we do not generally consider ourselves to be alters, aspects, facets etc. and prefer that those terms not be used for members of our collective by folks outside the collective
the number of headmates in our collective is difficult to count; there are about a dozen [atoms](#gem-atom), easily upwards of 1000* *[glitterbugs](#glitter-glitterbugs), tens of thousands of headmates that we encounter internally (enough to fill a [large town or small city](#headspace-mindscape)), however only [about 200 members front actively](https://pluralkit.xyz/s/lhexq/m) enough to have a registered [proxy](#proxy) and relatively few of those front often enough to be [familiar faces](https://pk.mt/g/peokh), even to external folks that know us quite well
#### callsign 
a string of numbers and letters that identifies what *[cohorts](#cohort)* (which each have unique letters) and thus also what *[districts](#district-guild)* (unique numbers) a member belongs to
* a member’s callsign can change if a *[council seat](#council-seat)* assigned to one of their districts changes, or if the member chooses to change what cohorts they are associated with
* current convention dictates that callsigns are typed in counting order (46 instead of 64) and then alphabetically, however we’re currently negotiating whether to go by order of what cohort a member identifies with most (as was the case back in the early 2000s)
#### cohort
a group of *[coordinates](#coordinate-coordinates)* who share similar values and personality characteristics; most coordinates belong to several cohorts
all members of a cohort have a callsign that contains the unique letter of a single *[atom](#gem-atom)* and a cohort can also be identified by referencing the name of the atomic member associated with that cohort
each cohort belongs to a single *[district](#district-guild)* (so far). and a district may contain multiple cohorts
ex: [Giles’ Cohort](https://pk.mt/g/qaiba) is also known as Cohort 8g (specified using callsign notation, showing the district number ‘8’ and the unique letter ‘g’)
#### family/sibling
the ‘family’ of a member are members that share one or more cohort with another member; such members may informally refer to each other as siblings or cousins, especially if they share a degree of similarity that goes beyond what might be indicated by *[cohort](#cohort)* membership
ex: [June](https://pk.mt/m/xcyal) and [Liz](https://pk.mt/m/ecuag) are considered close siblings by many within the system, as they share similar communication styles, interests, and skills
#### gem/atom
informal terms for headmates who are members of only one *[cohort](#cohort)*
gems are the only members to have just one letter in their callsign
many gems are quite common for us& to see internally, but most rarely *[front](#fronting)*
#### internal name
a *[concept-relationship thought](#concept-relationship-thought)* that each headmate chooses to represent themselves when communicating with other headmates
#### nickname
a short ASCII-character-only name that headmates chose (or had suggested to them) to more easily be identified by external folks
#### proxy
as a noun: the registered nickname, avatar(s), and profile a headmate has on [PluralKit](https://pluralkit.me/) (if they have one)
as a verb: to post a message using that name and avatar
### internal
all *[headmates](#headmate)*, *[headspaces](#headspace-mindscape)*, *[communication](#concept-relationship-thought)*, etc that are not immediately accessible to folk *[external](#external)* to the system
#### innerworld
refers to any interior *[headspaces](#headspace-mindscape)* as well as *[the front](#the-front)*
### system structure
a general term for the way one [system](https://morethanone.info/#terms) (or plural non-system) varies from another as a whole, aside from differences in headmates
one major aspect of the structure in this sense is whether members of a system are strictly individuals vs. aspects of a single person; most systems fall somewhere between the two (whereas plurality includes any experience outside of being a solitary, consistent person in a body, i.e. a [singlet](https://morethanone.info/#terms))
this term can also refer to the workings of inner spaces (see below) and how headmates in different parts of those spaces (or different substructures within the system) relate to one another
our system identifies our architecture as:
* decentralized (we do not have a host/core; "Alec" is just a *[shared persona](#shared-persona-singletsona)*)
* multiple (each of us is an individual, not a part of a central person)
* polyfragmented/super multiple (100+ members)
* fractal (having a complex, shifting membership)
#### the front
an inner space that headmates who are *[fronting](#fronting) *occupy; ours helps us coordinate who is taking active control of what (and also sometimes functions as a sort of holodeck that allows us to share imagined structures, scenarios etc. with each other)
#### headspace/mindscape
a shared inner space, distinct from (but potentially including) *[the front](#the-front)* our system has two different simultaneous mindscapes; 
a volcanic island with a small city/large town where *[headmates](#headmate)* can move freely, interact and maintain homes or personal spaces and mental constructs, while unaffiliated *[glitterbugs](#glitter-glitterbugs)* usually maintain a single, static location
a more abstract, conceptual space with a large, complex [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) style ‘graph’ of *[concepts and relationships](#concept-relationship-thought)*, in which a headmate’s personal relation to those concepts provides a sense of *[cohort](#cohort)*-based orientation for system members and in which *[glitterbugs](#glitter-glitterbugs) *can freely interact or veer off on their own
#### glitter/glitterbugs
an informal term for fragments within our collective, chosen to acknowledge the wholeness, agency, and one-among-many nature of these beings
we tend to think of glitterbugs as the smallest unit of consciousness to still have individual opinions and preferences
glitterbugs in our system are not generally able to front and often require an internal *[translator](#translator)* to convert their *[thought-communication](#concept-relationship-thought)* into English
*[cohorts](#cohort)* and specific *[headmates](#headmate)* in our collective have established and consistent flocks or swarms of glitterbugs that are active and grouped together when they are fronting
the position of the flock of glitterbugs within our conceptual *[headspace](#headspace-mindscape)* is where a headmates *[internal name](#internal-name)* comes from
unaffiliated glitterbugs (that do not participate in headmate “swarms”) are still considered *[coordinates](#coordinate-coordinates)* and entitled to the same [rights](commitments.md)
