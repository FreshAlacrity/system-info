## How Consensus Works

*A summary of the process we began to use to make system-wide decisions in 2006 (after a period of intense conflict within the system) and have revised and updated continually since then*



1. Someone asks for a Consensus
    1. anyone can ask for this on any issue at any time
    2. in order to begin the Consensus process:
        1. have a clear idea of what you want or what needs to happen to meet your needs
        2. clearly express if you intend to withdraw from or stop participating in something or not be expected to meet an existing expectation until a consensus decision is reached (so plans can be made around that)
        3. have a way to listen in on, contribute to, and/or be informed of how the discussion is proceeding (since folks initiating a Consensus are encouraged to participate)
    3. any assistance and/or accommodations needed to meet the conditions listed above must be made available by the community in question as soon as possible
2. Discuss exactly what the issue is
    1. define in concrete terms what will change or not change as the direct result of a consensus (or if one fails to happen) to the satisfaction of the person initiating the process
    2. the change should be something discrete and behavioral, as there’s no point in reaching a consensus about how people should feel because feelings don’t work that way - instead, decide what needs to be done
3. Take a quick vote
    1. after this point, anyone can request a vote at any time
    2. for any vote:
        1. make sure representatives are included from all groups of people who will be affected by a decision or lack of a decision, and when possible include all people affected
            1. every participant is encouraged to recruit additional participants that may be affected
            2. representatives must decline if they believe anyone they represent might decline and may only assent if they have had active assent communicated to them by everyone they represent
        2. anyone who needs the Consensus process to continue to assent should decline
        3. anyone feels like they’re uninformed on the issue or that any others are uninformed on the issue should decline (for example, if they suspect there may be indirect results of the change being discussed that also need to be discussed)
        4. any individual declining results in no consensus and the process continues as desired, otherwise the ‘no consensus reached’ conditions can begin (as determined by the person who initiated the process)
            1. because of this, it may be expedient to begin the vote with the people most likely to decline (as no additional votes are needed after any individual declines)
        5. if consensus is reached, inform the person who initiated the process as soon as possible
4. Discuss if anything should be done immediately and/or while the Consensus process is ongoing
    1. does anyone involved need to take a step back from their usual duties?
    2. does anyone need to inform themselves, have a chance to collect information, or have information made more accessible to them that might be relevant before proceeding?
    3. how long can inaction last before that will have consequences for the people involved?
    4. make sure everyone knows what the timescale and intention on that is and is informed if that changes
5. Pick someone to take notes/minutes on the process in case there needs to be a break
    1. try to pick someone who is less involved in the issue and make sure everyone agrees that they’re an acceptable choice; if not, more than one person can be selected (sometimes choosing a note taker for one Consensus process becomes an entire Consensus process itself)
    2. the note taker should:
        1. make a summary of information presented and what progress has been made towards a decision
        2. avoid making a note of who said what
        3. give a refresher when everyone regroups (anyone can contribute, but a note taker is expected to start it)
6. Pick a (relatively) disinterested party to act as a mediator:
    1. the mediator should:
        1. take notice when someone hasn’t been heard who might be affected and make sure they speak/their side or opinion is heard
        2. take notice of misunderstandings
        3. help translate and/or advocate for people when there are misunderstandings or difficulty being heard
        4. take time with individuals away from the group to make sure that any translations and/or advocacy are accurately representing their viewpoint
        5. take notice when things are getting heated and call for a time out/make sure the people involved have their needs met and aren’t distracted by other things
        6. enforce breaks in the discussion to make sure folks are able to meet their own needs and uphold other responsibilities etc.
        7. enforce the chosen speaking order (determined in the next step) when multiple people attempt to speak at once
7. Decide on an order to speak when multiple people want to speak at once
    1. prioritize leading with the quietest voices and those most affected by the issue, with folks that generally sway or influence others strongly going last
8. Start with going by speaking order and give your take on the issue
    1. include any information that is relevant to you and that you think may be relevant to the discussion (briefly; there will be more time to elaborate in the following rounds)
    2. avoid agreeing or disagreeing with prior speakers; give your own take and the position you're coming from relative to the issue at hand
9. Proceed in speaking order around the table until every person has assented to a particular course of action (i.e. unanimous consent)
    1. filibusters are not allowed; if you’re struggling to make a coherent point, the mediator can interrupt and talk to you privately to help convey what’s important to you at that moment when the group reconvenes
        1. if the chosen mediator isn’t capable of doing this or someone isn’t comfortable having them act in that capacity, they can choose a personal representative to do so instead
    2. don’t speak for anyone else unless they’ve specifically asked you to (and for mediators, check in frequently with people that your translations are feeling accurate to them)
    3. take a break when anyone needs to
        1. between rounds, check-in and discuss taking a break
        2. if possible agree on the duration for a break before taking one
        3. breaks can be any duration; 5 minutes, 2 hours, days, weeks, even years or until something else happens
        4. the mediator can suggest a duration and help with negotiating that
        5. if there’s no agreement on a break duration or anyone needs to take a break before a duration is agreed to, the Consensus group reconvenes as soon as all the participants are available
    4. not everyone needs to speak every round; it’s fine to popcorn as long as the mediator can easily get a word in to make sure quieter folks are being heard
    5. if somebody needs to step away after the initial introductory round, they can designate someone in the group to represent them while they’re out, but they should be kept informed and included in any votes that happen as much as possible
10. Act on the Consensus agreement in good faith
    1. if you're unsure how to honor the Consensus or unsure that someone else is doing so in the way you agreed to or intended, talk to other people who were present and if needed restart the Consensus process to discuss the ambiguity
    2. express gratitude for people who are changing their behavior to honor the Consensus agreement when you see it, regardless of your initial position or role in the process
    3. expect that even though everybody agreed, it may take time for people to change their behaviors and it’s a good idea to discuss with them how to support that (default to bringing it up with them privately first; if they seem unable or unwilling, start a new Consensus process to address it)
    4. if you can’t do so for any reason, the process re-starts and you can explain why you’re unable to proceed without punishment or judgment expressed about that (the inability to do something is not shameful, and being open about it means it can be addressed)
